# üåü StellarEase Smart Wallet: The Future of Web3 Authentication

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to our revolutionary Smart Wallet implementation! We're not just building another wallet - we're redefining what it means to interact with blockchain technology. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like passkeys and smart contracts, we've created a solution that bridges the gap between traditional wallets and the future of Web3.

## üí° The Problem

Traditional wallets face significant challenges:
- **Custodial Wallets**: Require users to manage 24-word seed phrases, creating a high barrier to entry
- **Non-custodial Wallets**: While they can sign smart contracts, they require separate steps for wallet creation and smart contract deployment
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Traditional wallets require additional authentication and separate transactions to implement programmable rules
- **Complex Setup**: Users must manage multiple steps: create wallet, deploy smart contract, link them together

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution

We've built a next-generation smart wallet that combines:
- **Passkey Authentication**: Secure, passwordless authentication using WebAuthn
- **Integrated Smart Contracts**: Wallet creation and programmable rules in a single authentication flow
- **Programmable Rules**: Built-in spending limits and budget controls
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js for optimal performance and developer experience

### Key Technologies

#### üéØ LaunchTube Integration
LaunchTube enables seamless smart contract deployment on the Stellar network. Instead of dealing with complex token management and faucets, we've streamlined the process through LaunchTube's powerful infrastructure.

#### üîÑ Mercury Layer
Our implementation uses Mercury as an intelligent abstraction layer that:
- Deploys Zephyr programs for efficient RPC interaction
- Provides organized, structured access to blockchain data
- Simplifies complex blockchain operations
- Enables programmable spending rules through smart contracts

#### üí™ Stellar SDK Integration
We've harnessed the full power of the Stellar SDK to:
- Implement passkey-based authentication
- Manage sophisticated signer systems
- Handle complex balance operations
- Create a truly decentralized experience
- Enforce programmable spending rules

### Smart Contract Features

Our wallet goes beyond traditional smart contract wallets by integrating programmable rules directly into the wallet creation process:

#### Budget Control
When creating a wallet with the passkey name `budget`, the smart contract enforces:
- Daily spending limits (e.g., 100 XLM per day)
- Transaction amount validation
- Automatic rejection of transactions exceeding limits
- Daily reset of spending allowances

#### Allowance Management
When using the passkey name `allowance`, the smart contract provides:
- Granular control over transaction amounts
- Time-based spending restrictions
- Category-based spending limits
- Automatic transaction validation
